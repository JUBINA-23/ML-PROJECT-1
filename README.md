# Energy Consumption (Linear Regression)
This dataset is designed for predicting energy consumption based on various building features and environmental factors. It contains data for multiple building types, square footage, the number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature and the day of the week. 

The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate energy consumption using these attributes. The dataset can be used for training machine learning models to forecast energy needs based on the building's characteristics. This is useful for understanding energy demand patterns and optimizing energy consumption in different building types and environmental conditions.

The dataset was first trained using the Linear Regression model which predicted 78.3% accuracy. The data was then boosted with Gradient Boosting, XGB and AdaBoost Regressor Models in which the highest accuracy of 96.8% was predicted by the Gradient Boosting Regressor.
